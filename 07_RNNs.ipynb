    "One example of the architecture is below; this is not the only one, but illustrates the some key components of RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fozD28d.png\" width=\"600\" alt='rnn'>\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: You might see it depicted differently in the other online materials, usually described as a feedforward network that gets used repeatedly. The above one makes more sense to me personally because the hidden state makes it a bit more subtle than that \"feedforward\" description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing that is different to neural nets introduced so far is the presence of a ***hidden state*** alongside the input data; I am going to refer to the tuple `(input_data, hidden_state)` as the ***input***. Here is that the predictions depends on the hidden state itself, and how `input_data` gets updated depends on the `hidden_state`. For example,  if `f(input_data) = (input_data + hidden_state, input_data)`, then `f(1) = 1` the first time but `f(1) = 2` the second time if `hidden_state = 0` to begin with, since the `hidden_state` has updated when `f` is called the second time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordering of operation above diagram is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose input `(input_data, hidden_state)`; `input_data` is from your training data, `hidden_state` is normally initialised to zeroes.\n",
    "2. `input_data` gets transformed in some way by a neural network block `A` (say).\n",
    "3. `hidden_state` gets transformed in some way by a different neural network block `B` (say).\n",
    "4. The returned array of numbers from `A` and `B` are summed and then activated (usually a `tanh` function, although `ReLU` is also used) and returns a `new_hidden_state` (which is an array of numbers).\n",
    "5. This `new_hidden_state` is transformed by another neural network block `C` and activated accordingly to give an `new_input`.\n",
    "6. Take the output (`new_input`, `new_hidden_state`) and pass through the RNN again.\n",
    "7. That generates a sequence of data, from which you can evaluate the loss again the provided training data.\n",
    "8. Do back-propagation relative to that loss, update the parameters in `A`, `B` and `C`, and iterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case there is some freedom in how you specify the size of the `hidden_state`, the neural network blocks (`A`, `B`, `C` can in principle all be different as long as their transformation rules are defined consistently), more things can be put in also (e.g. memory gates relating to ***LSTM*** and ***GRU*** architectures), and the neural networks can include convolutions also (e.g. ***ConvLSTM***). For this particular course we are only going to deal with the simple RNNs.\n",
