    "### General spiel about assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "***Your hand in should be in the form of a Jupyter notebook and associated files (if any) or as a GitHub repository link, and no other form of hand-ins will be accepted***. The use of Jupyter notebook and its Python component is part of the assessment criteria for the *presentation* and *coding* portion. Hand these in through Canvas in the usual way. You are graded on the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **scientific content** (40%)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **writing, presentation and referencing** (30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **use of Jupyter and/or Python coding** (30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **orginality** (10%; analysis beyond scope of course, use of memes and puns; surprise me)\n",
    "\n",
    "See the samples assignments I've made for the kind of things we might be expecting. We will probably be fairly loose with giving credit. 50% or below would count as unsatisfactory, while around 85% or above would be an A grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to use other Python packages, but see point b) below.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) ***Late assignments get a penalty of 1% of full marks per minute*** (so don't bother handing in anything after 2 hours). We will still mark it and give feedback, but you just don't get the credit. Excuses could be entertained but you will need sufficient evidence to back this up (e.g. your internet went down in the area and you have some pictorial/written demosntration for this).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) ***Your code needs to be able to run from scratch at least in the standard Google Colab***, otherwise you will get no marks from the 3rd attribute, and probably next to nothing in the 1st attribute (because your graphs probably won't exist). When you hand the notebooks in, you should pass it through `Kernel -> Restarts & Clear Output`, so the file is reasonably sized and only full of text (and if you don't *you get a 10% penalty* for not following instructions, for reasons in point c) below). The procedure here is that we will run the whole notebook from scratch probably on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), then mark the resulting outputs. **So make sure you test your code through Google Colab at least!** (or do your assignments on there, find whatever work flow that works for you).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you upload your assignment onto a GitHub repository and give us the link, with the appropriate things built in so that we can open it in Colab, then you get extra credit because of making the things openly reproducible and helping us somewhat (the things still need to run from fresh; just putting it on GitHub and linking to Colab by itself is worth nothing if it doesn't run).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) ***Plagiarism***: By all means consult each other, work together, or use AI tools, but the files you hand in should be done and written up separately. For allowing checks in Turnitin, you should pass it through `Kernel -> Restarts & Clear Output` before you hand it in. **The default for anyone accused with plagiarism is ZERO on the assignment**, and depending on whether you decide to contest and the result of the appeal, possibly lead to an official note of plagiarism on your transcript (I will allow people to argue but be be ready for possible consequences). \n",
    "\n",
    "A few things count as plagiarism:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copying between students, and the default is that ALL parties involved get zero for the assignment**, regardless of whether the side can demonstrate they were copied from (extra incentive to keep the writing separate).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copying text without citation is plagiarism**. Use quotation marks and give reference if you are directly lifting text, but don't do this too often (and will result in text looking cluttered, and not getting full credit for the *presentation* aspect). This includes content generated from AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code is a slightly more grey area**, but I will just say no one has ever really been punished for being cautious and generous with citations, but make sure you present it well (e.g. overburdening text with citations will make the presentation ugly, and will not get full credit for the *presentation* aspect say). This includes content generated from AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will just make the point that we don't tend to accuse plagiarism unless we have enough proof, and if we are doing it it probably means we think we have a sufficiently strong case that is probably not worth arguing against (because then penalty then gets increased)."

    "\n",
    "For this assignment you have a choice of either using the Argo data (`argo_data_scrap.ipynb`), bacteria data (`bacteria_data_scrap.ipynb`) or some numerical model data (`model_data_scrap.ipynb`), up to you, but do not use other choices of data (you have that option in the extended project later). We talked about the pros and cons already.\n",
    "\n",
    "With any of those choices you should demonstrate the ability to deploy some things we have gone through in sessions 4 to 7, i.e. the \"classic\" neural networks (MLPs, CNNs, Autoencoders, RNNs). Up to you what you choose to deploy, but if you do something you should justify why you are doing it with a scientific/practical reason (and comment accordingly on what happens if you don't do it). You can decide whether to use the `Keras` interface, up to you, but you should use `PyTorch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get high marks by doing few things but all really well, or doing lots of things reasonably enough, there is no one way that is \"right\" (just like there is no single way of something being a \"good\" article, although there are usually commonalities between \"good\" things). I would recommend doing two flavours of neural networks, doing one single task (classification or regression), and being reasonably thorough with model comparison, sensitivity on hyper-parameter exploration, model validation and so forth. Your document should include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Describe what the data includes, and explain why one might want to do regression and/or classification with it [*be able to do some background research*]\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Perform regression and/or classfication on the data with some methods (along with all the other bits that come with it, e.g. describing the method) [*practise and demonstrate using Python to do some scientific computation*]\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Write some of these things up and describe them using the Markdown cells [*practise and demonstrate understanding of Jupyter notebooks*]\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Any others that could fall under originality (memes welcome, but scientific content should always come first rather than just random content for the hell of it)\n",
    "\n",
    "See the relevant `*_scrap.ipynb` notebooks for suggested things to do with the data (I've kept the descriptions quite generic)."
